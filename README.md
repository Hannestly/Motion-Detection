disclaimer: The following algorithm utilizes OpenCV library to achieve three things

1. To display the image, and draw shape
2. Convert each frame into matrix
3. color video to gray scale 

### How to start ###
- Clone the repository
- If you don't have openCV2, numpy, imutils already downloaded, 
    1. open command line, open the directory to the cloned folder
    2. type 'pip install -r requirement.txt'
- have your video of choice moved into the same file containing motion.py
- compile the motion.py
- enter the name of the video you want to execute 

e.g. to execute video.mp4, in commandline
```
enter the address of your video video.mp4
```
